# mercutie
my qmk config for the mechwild mercutio i use

"I paid for the 28k bytes on the ATMega, I'm gonna use (almost) all of them"

If you don't feel comfortable with the size of the compiled file, just set `MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = false`

Use the hex file at your own risk, or compile it, I can't guarantee that it'll work tho :)
